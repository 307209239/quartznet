This release concentrates on tweaking the DI story and fixing some found dependency issues.

Now Quartz no longer has hard dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, you need to add that dependency to your project
if you are using Microsoft SQL Server as backing store for your project. Now requirement is in line with other providers/drivers.

There's also important fix for SQL Server where varying text parameter sizes caused query plan pollution.
